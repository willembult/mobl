To build
--------

To build the mobl compiler you will need a recent version of Eclipse
(3.5+) and [Spoofax](http://www.spoofax.org). When those are
installed, simply clone the mobl repository and import it into
Eclipse, then build the project (Ctrl+Alt+b or Ctrl+Cmd+b).

To use plug-in
--------------

You can easily install the plug-in from the
`http://mobl-lang.org/update` update site. But to keep up-to-date with
the latest developments you will have to build it yourself.
